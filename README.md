# SG Interactive - Census

* Description - Given a list of people with their birth and end years (all between 1900 and 2000), find the year with the most number of people alive.

* Code - Solve using a language of your choice and dataset of your own creation.

This is my solution to the programming challenge, created in C# in Unity 5.3.1. It creates a dataset that is limited to birth/end dates occurring within the specified period, then renders a point graph using Unity's UI showing each year's total population, with the highest population year's node colored green.

Pressing "T" while running will continuously generate/display a new dataset.
